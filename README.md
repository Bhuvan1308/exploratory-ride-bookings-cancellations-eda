# Exploratory Data Analysis of Ride Bookings & Cancellations

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of ride booking data to understand booking trends, cancellation behavior, and ride demand patterns.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Analysis Performed
- Booking status distribution
- Hourly and day-wise ride demand analysis
- Ride cancellation trends
- Vehicle type usage analysis
- Payment method distribution
- Turnaround time analysis (V_TAT and C_TAT)
- Correlation analysis between ride distance and booking value

## Key Insights
- Ride demand shows strong hourly and weekday variations.
- Cancellations are higher on specific days, indicating operational challenges.
- Booking value is not strictly distance-based and is influenced by factors such as vehicle type, surge pricing, and time of booking.

## Repository Contents
- `Ride_Booking_and_Cancellation_Analysis.ipynb` – analysis notebook
- Dataset file (if included)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end exploratory data analysis using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to derive business-driven insights on ride bookings and cancellations.
